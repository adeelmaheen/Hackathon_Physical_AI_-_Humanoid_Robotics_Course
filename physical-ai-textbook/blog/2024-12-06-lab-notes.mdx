I am Maheen Arif, a full-stack agentic AI and humanoid robotics developer. This blog is the living lab-notes companion to the Physical AI Textbook.

## What I share here
- Build logs for the textbook modules (ROS 2 fundamentals, simulation, NVIDIA Isaac, vision-language-action)
- Agentic control patterns that balance latency, safety, and reliability
- Shipping playbooks for getting real robots from prototype to field-ready
